# Hash Tables
A *hash table* is an effective data structure for implementing dictionaries.
Average time: 0(1)
Worst case: 0(n)

## Direct-address Tables
To represent the dynamic set a *direct address table* can be used denoted by T[0..m-1] in which each position/*slot* corresponds to a key in the universe U.

A direct-address table can store the object in the slot itself which saves space.

Exercises:

1.1:
```
MAXIMUM(T, m)
    max = - infinity
    for k = 0 to m - 1
    if T[k] != NIL and max < T[k]
        max = T[k]
    return max
```
Worst-case would be 0(m) time

1.2: Utilizing a bit vector data structure to represent a dynamic set of distinct elements we can represent keys < m by a string of m bits, V[0..m -1], in which every position occupied by 1 relates to a key in S. 

*Downside of direct addressing*: If universe of keys (U) is large then storing a table T of size U may be impractical/impossible!

1.3:
Insert: Appends element to list in 0(1) time
Delete: removes element from the list in 0(1) time
Search: returns first element in 0(1) time

 
## Hash Tables
Hash tables requires much less storage than a direct-address table. You can maintain the benefits of searching in constant time without having bloated storage requirements. 

With hashing an element is stored in slot h(k) --> We use a *hash function* h to compute the slot from the key k.
h maps to universe U of keys into the slots of a *hash table* T[0...m-1]

h: U -> {0, 1,...., m-1}

h(k) is the hash value of key k
key k hashes to slot h(k)

A *collision* is when 2 keys hash to the same slot.
**Collision resolution by chaining**
In *chaining* we place all the elements that hash to the same slot into the same linked list

**CHAINED-HASH-INSERT(T,x)** 0(1)
insert x at the head of list T[h(x.key)]
**Chained-HASH-SEARCH(T,k)** 0(n)
search for an element with key k in list T[h(k)]
**CHAINED-HASH-DELETE(T, x)** 0(1)
delete x from the list T[h(x.key)]

Worst-case behavior of hashing with chaining is *terrible*: all n keys hash to the same slot creating a list of length n. 0(n)

All dictionary operations in 0(1) time on average
