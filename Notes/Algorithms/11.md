# Hash Tables
A *hash table* is an effective data structure for implementing dictionaries.
Average time: 0(1)
Worst case: 0(n)

## Direct-address Tables
To represent the dynamic set a *direct address table* can be used denoted by T[0..m-1] in which each position/*slot* corresponds to a key in the universe U.

A direct-address table can store the object in the slot itself which saves space.

Exercises:

1.1:
```
MAXIMUM(T, m)
    max = - infinity
    for k = 0 to m - 1
    if T[k] != NIL and max < T[k]
        max = T[k]
    return max
```
Worst-case would be 0(m) time

1.2: Utilizing a bit vector data structure to represent a dynamic set of distinct elements we can represent keys < m by a string of m bits, V[0..m -1], in which every position occupied by 1 relates to a key in S. 


1.3:
Insert: Appends element to list in 0(1) time
Delete: removes element from the list in 0(1) time
Search: returns first element in 0(1) time
