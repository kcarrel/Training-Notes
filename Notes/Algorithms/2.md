# Getting Started

## Insertion Sort
**Sorting Problem**
**Input:** A sequence of n numbers (a1, a2, ..... an)
**Output:** A permutation (reordering) (a1, a2, .... an) of the input sequence such as a, <= a2 .... <= an.

**Insertion Sort**
```
for j = 2 to A.length
    key = A[j]
    //Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1..j-1]
    i = j - 1
    while i > 0 and A[i] > key
        A[i + 1] = A[i]
        i = i - 1
    A[i + 1] = key
```

Numbers that we want to sort are *keys*.

Difference between pseudo-code vs "real" code is that we ignore syntax and use whatever is clear/concise to specify a given algorithm. Not actually concerned with software engineering.        

*In place* means that making changes within the provided structure rather than making a new structure. 

**Three outcomes that must be proven about a loop invariant:**
- *Initialization:* it is true prior to the first iteration of the loop
- *Maintenance:* It is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration
- *Termination:* When the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct.

1.1: On paper

1.2:
```
for j = 2 to A.length
    key = A[j]
    i = j - 1
    while i > 0 and A[i] < key
        A[i + 1] = A[i]
        i = i - 1
    A[i + 1] = key
```

1.3:  
```
linear search(array, target)
    i = 0
    while i < array.length
        return i if array[i] == target
    end
    return NIL

```

1.4:
```
Input: 2 arrays
Output: 1 array containing the sum of the 2 integers
add(array A, array B)
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < array A. length 
        result[i] = array A[i] + array B [i]
    end
    return result
end
```

## Analyzing Algorithms

**Analyzing** an algorithm means predicting the resources that an algorithm requires. 

In the **random-access machine (RAM)** model of computation instructions are executed one after an-other, with no concurrent operations. 
**RAM model**
- arithmetic 
- data movement (load, store, copy)
- control (conditional and unconditional branch, subroutine call and return)
- Data types (integer and floating point)

The best notion for *input size* depends on problem studied. Input can be the total number of bits needed to represent the input in ordinary binary notation or number of vertices/edges in a graph.

The *running time* on a particular input is the number of steps executed.


**Analysis of Insertion Sort:**
Best case scenario: Linear function 0(n)
Worst case scenario: Quadratic Function O(n^2)

**Worst-case and average-case analysis:**
The *worst case running time* is the most focused metric because:
- Gives the upper-bound of running time. 
- For some algos, worst case occurs fairly often. 
- "Average case" is often roughly as bad as the worst case. 

**Order of Growth:**

**Exercises**
2.1:
Î˜(n3)
2.2:
```
Pseudocode:
selection sort(array A)
    i = 1
    for i ... A.length -1
        min = i
        j = i + 1
        for j ... A.length
            if array A[j] < A[min]
                min = j
        temp = A[i]
        A[i] = A[min]
        A[min] = temp
end
```
Loop invariants: A sorted array

Why n-1? Because it is comparing 2 elements you don't need to transfer both pointers to the end just a.length and a.length - 1

Best-case and worst-case are O(n2) <-- nested loops

2.3: On average 50% needs to be checked and 100% needs to be checked for the worst case. --> O(n).

2.4: Make a check at the first step to see if it is already sorted, if so return.
