**Reccurrences**
Recurrences go hand in hand with DAC paradigm because they give us a natural way to characterize running times of DAC algorithms.

*Recurrence* is an equation or inequality that describes a function in terms of its value on smaller inputs. 

**The methods for solving recurrences (obtaining Big O)**
- Substitution method: guess a bound then use mathematical induction to prove our guess correct
- Recursion-tree method: converts the recurrence into a tree whose nodes represent the costs incurred at various levels of the recursion.
- Master method: provides bounds for recurrences of the form 
ex Master method:
T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)

## The maximum-subarray problem
The buy on one day sell on another for max return
Brute force:
Try every possible pairs of buy/sell dates to see which is multiple. The best would be a (n^2).

Transformation: To design an algo with o(n^2) run time - create a subarray showing the difference between prices after day i -1 and after day i. This is an interesting approach to use a subarray when the array contains some negative numbers. 

**DAC approach**
Divide the subarray into 2 subarrays of as equal size as possible 
```
FIND-MAX-CROSSING-SUBARRAY(A, low, mid, high)
    left-sum = -infinity
    sum = 0
    for i = mid downto low
        sum = sum + A[i]
        if sum > left-sum
            left-sum = sum
            max-left = i
    right-sum = - infinity
    sum = 0
    for j = mid + 1 to high
        sum = sum + A[ij]
        if sum > right-sum
            right-sum = sum
            max-right = j
    return(max-left, max-right, left-sum + right-sum)


FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY(A,low,high)
    if high == low
        return(low, high, A[low])
    else mid = [(low + high)/2]
        (left-low, left-high, left-sum) =
            FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY(A, low, mid)
        (right-low, right-high, right-sum) =
            FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY(A, mid + 1, high)
        (cross-low, cross-high, cross-sum) =
            FIND-MAX-CROSSINg-SUBARRAY(A, low, mid, high)
        if left-sum >_ right-sum and left-sum >_ cross-sum
            return (left-low, left-high, left-sum)
        elseif right-sum >_ left-sum and right-sum >_ cross-sum
            return (right-low, right-high, right-sum)
        else return (cross-low,cross-high, cross-sum)
```

T(n) = O(n log n)

## Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication
```
SQUARE-MATRIX-MULTIPLY(A,B)
    n = A.rows
    let C be a new n x n matrix
    for i = 1 to n
        for j = 1 to n
            cij = 0
            for k = 1 to n
                cij = cij + aik * bkj
    return C
```
Runs in O(n log^log 7)

**A DAC approach**
```
SQUARE-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE(A,B)
    n = A.rows
    let C be a new n x n matrix
    if n == 1
        c11 = a11 * b11
    else partition A, B, and C as in equations
        C11 = SQUARE-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE(A11, B11) + SQUARE-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE(A12, B21)
        C12 = SQUARE-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE(A11, B12) + SQUARE-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE(A12, B22)
        C21 = SQUARE-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE(A21, B11) + SQUARE-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE(A22, B21)
        C22 = SQUARE-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE(A21, B12) + SQUARE-MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE(A22, B22)
    return C
```
Run is T(n) = 0(n^3) making it no faster than the naive solution.

**Strassen's Method**
The key to this method is reducing the amount of matrix multiplications that needs to be done. 

*4 steps*
- Divide the input matrices into submatrices
- Create 10 matricies each which is n/2 X n/2 and is the sum or difference of two matrices created in step 1
- Use the submatrices and 10 matrices to recursively compute 7 matrix products
- Compute the desired submatrices of the result matrix C by adding and ubstracting various combos
T(n) 7T(n/2) + O(n^2)
