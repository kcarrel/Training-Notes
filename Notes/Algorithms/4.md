**Reccurrences**
Recurrences go hand in hand with DAC paradigm because they give us a natural way to characterize running times of DAC algorithms.

*Recurrence* is an equation or inequality that describes a function in terms of its value on smaller inputs. 

**The methods for solving recurrences (obtaining Big O)**
- Substitution method: guess a bound then use mathematical induction to prove our guess correct
- Recursion-tree method: converts the recurrence into a tree whose nodes represent the costs incurred at various levels of the recursion.
- Master method: provides bounds for recurrences of the form 
ex Master method:
T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)

## The maximum-subarray problem
The buy on one day sell on another for max return
Brute force:
Try every possible pairs of buy/sell dates to see which is multiple. The best would be a (n^2).

Transformation: To design an algo with o(n^2) run time - create a subarray showing the difference between prices after day i -1 and after day i. This is an interesting approach to use a subarray when the array contains some negative numbers. 

**DAC approach**
Divide the subarray into 2 subarrays of as equal size as possible 
```
FIND-MAX-CROSSING-SUBARRAY(A, low, mid, high)
    left-sum = -infinity
    sum = 0
    for i = mid downto low
        sum = sum + A[i]
        if sum > left-sum
            left-sum = sum
            max-left = i
    right-sum = - infinity
    sum = 0
    for j = mid + 1 to high
        sum = sum + A[ij]
        if sum > right-sum
            right-sum = sum
            max-right = j
    return(max-left, max-right, left-sum + right-sum)


FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY(A,low,high)
    if high == low
        return(low, high, A[low])
    else mid = [(low + high)/2]
        (left-low, left-high, left-sum) =
            FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY(A, low, mid)
        (right-low, right-high, right-sum) =
            FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY(A, mid + 1, high)
        (cross-low, cross-high, cross-sum) =
            FIND-MAX-CROSSINg-SUBARRAY(A, low, mid, high)
        if left-sum >_ right-sum and left-sum >_ cross-sum
            return (left-low, left-high, left-sum)
        elseif right-sum >_ left-sum and right-sum >_ cross-sum
            return (right-low, right-high, right-sum)
        else return (cross-low,cross-high, cross-sum)
```

T(n) = O(n log n)
