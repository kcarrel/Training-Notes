# Heapsort 
Heapsort's running time is O(n log n) and sorts in place: only a constant number of array elements are stored outside the input array at any time.

This combines the better aspects of merge sort(run time) and insertion sort(space).

*Heap* is was originally used as "garbage-collected storage" but in this context a *heap data structure* is not garbage-collected storage. 

## Heaps
The (binary) *heap* data structure:
- an array
- can view as a nearly complete binary tree

Parent(i)
return[i/2]

Left(i)
return 2i

Right(i)
return 2i + 1

Good implementations of heapsort often implement these procedures as "macros" or "in-line" procedures.

2 Kinds of Binary Heaps:
- Max-Heaps: the max heap property is that for every node i the value is at most the value of its parent.       
- Min-Heaps: the min heap property is that for every node i the value is more than the value of its parent. The smallest element is at the root.
Both: the values in the nodes satisfy a *heap property*

For a heapsort algo - Max-heaps are used. 

The *height* of heap of n elements is O(log n)

Exercises:

1.1 - Between 2^n and (2^n+1) -1
1.2 2^height, (2^height + 1) - 1
1.3: In accordance with the max-heap property - the root of the subtree must have children that is less than or equal to it. This property applies to all descendants of the root as well.
1.4: It will likely reside in the second half of the heap array on the highest level.
1.5: Yes - for any element the values to the left will be smaller and right will be larger.
1.6: No - the max-heap property is being violated by 7


## Maintaining the Heap Property
In order to maintain the max-heap property we call procedure *MAX-HEAPIFY* 

```
MAX-HEAPIFY(A, i)
    l = LEFT(i)
    r = RIGHT(i)
    if l <_ A.heap-size and A[l] and A[i]
        largest = l
    else 
        largest = i
    if r <_ A.heap-size and A[r] > A[largest]
        largest = r
    if largest != i
        exchange A[i] with A[largest]
        MAX-HEAPIFY(A,largest)
```

This will float down the smaller numbers towards the bottom of the heap.

Runtime - T(n) <_ T(2n/3) + 0(1) or alternatively runtime on a node of height h as O(h)

Exercises
2.1 - on paper
2.2 
```
MIN-HEAPIFY(A, i)
    l = LEFT(i)
    r = RIGHT(i)
    if l <_ A.heap-size and A[l] <> A[i]
        smallest = l
    else 
        smallest = i
    if r <_ A.heap-size and A[r] < A[i]
        smallest = r
    if smallest != i
        exchange A[i] with A[smallest]
        MIN-HEAPIFY(A,smallest)
```
Same runtime

2.3: No effect - A[i] is root and the procedure ends
2.5:
```
#define PARENT(i) ((i - 1) / 2)
#define LEFT(i)   (2 * i + 1)
#define RIGHT(i)  (2 * i + 2)

typedef struct {
    int *nodes;
    int length;
    int heap_size;
} heap;

void max_heapify(heap A, int i) {
    int left, right, largest, temp;

    while(1) {
        left  = LEFT(i);
        right = RIGHT(i);

        if (left < A.heap_size && A.nodes[left] > A.nodes[i])
            largest = left;
        else
            largest = i;

        if (right < A.heap_size && A.nodes[right] > A.nodes[largest])
            largest = right;

        if (largest == i)
            return;

        temp = A.nodes[i];
        A.nodes[i] = A.nodes[largest];
        A.nodes[largest] = temp;

        i = largest;
    }
}
```
## Building a Heap
MAX-HEAPIFY can be used to bottom-up convert an array to a max-heap 

```
BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A)
A.heap-size = A.length
for i = [A.length/2] downto 1
    MAX-HEAPIFY(A,i)
```
Call MAX-HEAPIFY on each node (array element).
3.1: on paper
3.2: We need to call the loop in order to pass the condition of having the subtrees be max-heaps.

3.3:
## The Heapsort Algorithm
```
HEAPSORT(A)
    BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A)
    for i = A.length downto 2
        exchange A[1]n with A[i]
        A.heap-size = A.heapsize - 1
        MAX-HEAPIFY (A,1)
```
Takes 0(n log n)

Exercises
4.1 - paper
4.3 - Both are still 0(n log n) due to the conversion into a heap then the looped sorting

## Priority queues
Heapsort is swell but can be easily beat by a good implementation of quicksort. 

A *priority queue* is one fo the most popular applications of a heap.
**2 Forms**
- Max-priority queues
- Min-priority queues 

A *priority queue* is a data structure for maintaining a set S of elements, each with an associate value called a *key*.

**Max-Priority Queue**
supports the following operations:
- *INSERT(S,x)* - inserts the element x into the set S
- *MAXIMUM(S)* - returns element of S with largest key
- *EXTRACT-MAX(S)* - removes and returns the element of S with the largest key
- *INCREASE-KEY(S,x,k)* -increases the value of element x's key to the new value k, which is assumed to be at least as large as x's current key value


**Min-Priority Queue**
- *INSERT*
- *MINIMUM*
- *EXTRACT-MIN*
- *DECREASE-KEY*

```
HEAP-MAXIMUM(A)
    return A[1]

HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX(A)
    if A.heap-size < 1
        error "heap underflow"
    max = A[1]
    A[1] = A[A.heap-size]
    A.heap-size = A.heap-size - 1
    MAX-HEAPIFY(A,1)
    return max

```
HEAP-EXTRACT MAX run time: 0(log n)
```
HEAP-INCREASE-KEY(A,i,key)
    if key < A[i]
        error "new key is smaller than current key"
    A[i] = key
    while i > 1 and A[Parent(i)] < A[i]
        exchange A[i] with A[PARENT(i)]
        i = PARENT(i)
```
HEAP-INCREASE-KEY run time: 0(log n)

```
MAX-HEAP-INSERT(A,key)
A.heap-size = A.heap-size + 1
A[A.heap-size] = -infinity
HEAP-INCREASE-KEY(A, A.heap-size, key)
```
MAX-HEAP-INSERT run time: 0(log n)
