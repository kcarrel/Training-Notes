# Quicksort
The *quicksort* algorithm has a worst-case run time of O(n^2). Quicksort is a practical choice (despite run time) because it is efficient on the average - O(n log n) and it sorts in place. 

## Description of quicksort
Quicksort applies that divide and conquer paradigm:
- **Divide**: Partition the array into 2 subarrays and such that each element of A[p...q-1] is less than ojr equal to A[q] which in turn is less than or equal to each element of A[q+ 1...r]. Compute the index q as part of this partitioning procedure. 
- **Conquer**: Sort the 2 subarrays by recursive calls to quicksort
- **Combine**: If subarrays are sorted than the entire array is now sorted

```
QUICKSORT(A, p, r)
    if p < r
        q = PARTITION(A, p, r)
        QUICKSORT(A, p, q-1)
        QUICKSORT(A, q+1, r)

PARTITION(A, p, r)
    x = A[r]
    i = p - 1
    for j = p to r - 1
        if A[j] <_ x
            i = i + 1
            exchange A[i] with A[j]
    exchange A[i + 1] with A[r]
    return i + 1
``` 
Run time of PARTITION is 0(n)

Exercises:
7.1: on paper
7.2: it would return r
```
QUICKSORT(A, p, r)
    if p < r
        q = PARTITION(A, p, r)
        QUICKSORT(A, p, q-1)
        QUICKSORT(A, q+1, r)

PARTITION(A, p, r)
    x = A[r]
    i = p - 1
    count = 0
    for j in range(p, r)
        if A[j] == x
            count += 1
        if A[j] <_ x
            i = i + 1
            exchange A[i] with A[j]
    exchange A[i + 1] with A[r]
    return i + 1 - count /2
``` 
7.3: We only need to traverse the array once
7.4: Flip the if condition A[j] to >= x

## Performance of quicksort
Run time is highly dependent on if partition is even or not. 

If balanced - algorithm runs asymptotically as fast as merge sort.
If unbalanced - it *can* run asymptotically as slowly as insertion sort. 

**Worst-case partitioning**
Worst-case is no better than quicksort - 0(n^2)
0(n^2) if the array is already completed sorted

**Best-case partitioning**
An equally balanced partition would have a O(n log n) run time

**Balanced partitioning**
The run time is 0(n log n) whenever the split has constant proportionality

**Intuition for the average case**
The running time of quicksort, when levels alternate between good and bad splits, is like the running time of good splits: 0(n log n) 

## A randomized version of quicksort
Instead of using A[r] as the pivot, select a random chosen element from the subarray A[p...r].
```
RANDOMIZED-PARTITION(A, p, r)
i = RANDOM(p,r)
exchange A[r] with A[i]
return PARTITION(A,p,r)

RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT(A, p, r)
if p < r
    q = RANDOMIZED-PARTITION(A, p, r)
    RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT(A, p, q - 1)
    RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT(A, q + 1, r)
```
