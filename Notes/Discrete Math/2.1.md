# Introduction to Sets

All of mathematics can be described with sets.

**Set**: A collection of things.
ex: {..., -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...}
The dots indicated the pattern continues forever in positive/negative directions.
**Elements**: Items in the set
**Infinite set**: Infinitely many elements
**Finite set**: Finite amount of elements

Two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements despite if the order is not the same.

Description of a set: A = {2,3,4,5} "2 is an element of A"

Natural numbers(positive whole numbers) are denoted by N.
Integers are denoted by Z.
Real numbers are denoted by R.
Rational numbers are denoted by Q.

**Cardinality**: number of elements in a set or grouping

**Empty set**: {} 
{0} is not an empty set --> it contains an empty set!

**Set-builder notation** used to describe sets that are too big to list between braces:

General Syntax: X = {expression : rule}

ex: E = {..., -6,-4., -2, 0, 2, 4, 6,...} becomes
E = {2n: n E Z} which is equivalent to "E equals the set of all things of form 2n, such that n is an element of Z".

## Exercises for Section 2.1

### C - find the cardinalities of following sets
29: 3
31: 1
