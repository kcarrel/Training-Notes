# The Cartesian Product

**Cartesian Product**: Multiplication of two sets A and B to produce a new set denoted as A X B.
*Useful* for describing and analyzing sample space

ex: A = {k,l,m} and B = {q,r}
A x B = {(k,q), (k,r), (l,q), (l,r), (m,q), (m,r)}
**Ordered Pair**: a list (x,y) of 2 things x and y enclosed in parentheses and separated by a comma. 

**Ordered triple**: a list (x,y,z)
