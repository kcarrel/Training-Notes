# Subsets

**Subset** - a part of a larger group of related things
ex:  If every element of set A is also an element of set B then we say A is a subset of B. 

*An empty set is a subset of every set!*

If a finite set has n elements, then it has 2^n subsets.

## Exercises for Section 2.3

### A - List all the subsets for the following sets
1:
{}
{1}
{2}
{3}
{4}
{1,2}
{1,3}
{1,4}
{2,3}
{2,4}
{3,4}
{1,2,3}
{1,2,4}
{1,3,4}
{2,3,4}
{1,2,3,4}
3: 
{}
{{R}}
5:
{}
{0}
### B
9: {{3,2}, {3,a}, {2,a}}
11: {} --> 0
### C 
13: True - sets are equal
15: True
