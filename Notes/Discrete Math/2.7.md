# Venn Diagrams
**Venn Diagrams** are graphical representations of sets.
*Important points*
- If an expression involving sets uses only union, then parentheses are **optional**
- If an expression involving sets uses only intersection, then parentheses are **optional**
- If an expression uses both union and intersection that parentheses are **essential**
