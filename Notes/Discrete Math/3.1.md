# Logic
**Logic** is a systematic process of deducing information correctly. 

## Statements
**Statement** is a sentence or a mathematical expression that is either definitely true or definitely false. 
**Open sentence** is a sentence that has a truth dependent on a value of one or more variables. 

In proving that statements are true, we use logic to help us understand statements and to combine pieces of information to produce new pieces of information.
