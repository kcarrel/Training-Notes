# Conditional Statements
*Q is a necessary condition for P*
ex:
Consider the following statement about a.
R: If the integer a is a multiple of 6, then a is divisible by 2.

P: The integer a is a multiple of 6.
Q: The integer a is divisible by 2.
R: If P, then Q.

**Truth Table for Conditionals**
| P | Q | P=>Q |
|---|---|-----|
| T | T | T   |
| T | F | F  |
| F | T | T   |
| F | F | T   |

## Exercises
1: If the determinant of a matrix is not zero then it is invertible.
2: If a function is differentiable then it is continuous.
3: If a function is continuous then it is integrable. 
4: If a function is a polynomial then it is rational.
5: If an integer is divisible by 4 then it is divisible by 8.
6: If a surface has only one side then it is non-orientable.
7: If a series converges absolutely, then it converges.
8: If a geometric series has a |ratio| < 1 then it converges.
9: If a function is continuous then it is integrable.
