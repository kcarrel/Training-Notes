# Algorithms
Algorithm: A sequence of commands that if followed correctly will result in the desired outcome. 
To run or execute an algorithm means to apply it to input and obtain output.

## 6.1 Variables and the Assignment Command
A **variable** is a symbol that can be assigned to various values. It represents a specific value at any point in time and that value can change over time. 

## 6.2 Loops and Algorithm Notation
ex:
while P(x) do
    Command 1
    Command 2
    ....
    Command n
end

If P(x) is true then the while loop executes Commands 1 ... n which may change the value of x. It continues to execute until P(x) is false.
First iteration - first execution of the while loop and so on and so forth

    x := 1
    while x <= 6 do
        y := 2 * x
        output y
        x := x + 1
    end
    

    x := 1
    while x <= 6 do
        y := 2 * x
        output y
        x := x + 1
    end

    **Infinite loop**
    x:=1
    while x≤ 6 do
        y:=2·x
        x:=x−1
    end
    output y
