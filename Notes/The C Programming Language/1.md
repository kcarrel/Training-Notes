# A Tutorial Introduction

C is a general purpose programming language that has:
- Economy of expression
- Modern control flower and data structure
- Rich set of operators

C is not:
- "very high level" or big
- Specialized to a particular area of application

Fundamental C characters:
- Characters
- Integers
- Floating point numbers of several sizes

C Hierarchy of derived data types:
- pointers
- arrays
- structures
- unions

Expressions are formed from *operators and operands*.

Fundamental C control-flow constructions:
- cases(switch)
- statement grouping
- decision making(if-else)
- looping with termination at top (while, for)
- early exit loop (break)
- Termination at bottom loop (do)

Return types: basic types, structures, unions or pointers. 

Local variables are created "automatic" or anew with each invocation. 

C **does not**:
- have built in operations to deal directly with composite objects
- does not define any storage allocation other than static definition 
- no heap or garbage collection
- no input/output facilities - no READ or WRITE statements
- no built-in file access methods

C **does offer**:
- straight forward, single-thread control flow
- tests
- loops
- grouping
- subprograms (not multiprogramming)
- parallel operations
- synchronization
- coroutines

## Getting Started

Main is special - your program begins executing at the beginning of main. 

to compile a file
$ cc filename.c

To run a file
$ ./a.out

*printf* is a library function that prints the following output. Never supplioes a newline auto so many calls can be used to build up an output line.

A *escape sequence* like \n provides general and extensible mech for representing hard-to-type or invisible characters. 
\t for tab
\b for backspace
\" for doublequote
\\ for the backslash itself


## Variables and Arithmetic Expressions

To make a comment use the structure "/* */"

**All variables must be declared before they are used**

A declaration announces properties of variables - contains type name and list of variables
ex: int fahr, celsius
    int lower, upper, step;

16-bit integers are between -32768 and +32767

A float number is typically a 32 it quantity with at least six significant digits and magnitude generally between about 10^-38 and 10^+38

C provides several other basic data types besides int and float:
char: character- a single byte
short: short integer
long: long integer
double: double-precision floating point

Recommended:
- always indent statements
- write only one statement per line
- use blanks around operators to classify grouping
**Pick a style that suits you, then use it consistently**

Integer division *truncates* any fractional part is discarded. 

%d specifies an integer argument, so the statement
    printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);
causes the values of the two integers fahr and celsisu to be printed, with a tab (\t) between them. 

*scanf* is like printf, except that it reads input instead of writing output.

%d ................. print as decimal integer
%6d ................. print as decimal integer, at least 6 characters wide
%f .................. print as floating point
%6f .................... print as floating point, at least 6 characters wide
%.2f ..................... print as floating point, 2 characters after decimal point 
%6.2f ..................... print as floating point, at least 6 wide and 2 after decimal point 
%o ........... octal
%x .............. hexadecimal
%c ................character
%s ................ character string
%% ................ for % itself

## The For Statement
Added in the For loop example of the temperature conversion and then reversed it.

The *for* is usually appropriate for loops in which the initialization and increment are single statements and logically related, since it is more compact than *while* and it keeps the loop control statements together ni one place.

## Symbolic Constants
**Its bad practice to bury numbers in a program -- they convey little information to a reader and are hard to change systemtically**

A define line defines a symbolic name or symbolic constant to be a particular string of characters:

#define name replacement text ------> any occurrence of name will be replaced by the corresponding replacement text.
