# A Tutorial Introduction

C is a general purpose programming language that has:
- Economy of expression
- Modern control flower and data structure
- Rich set of operators

C is not:
- "very high level" or big
- Specialized to a particular area of application

Fundamental C characters:
- Characters
- Integers
- Floating point numbers of several sizes

C Hierarchy of derived data types:
- pointers
- arrays
- structures
- unions

Expressions are formed from *operators and operands*.

Fundamental C control-flow constructions:
- cases(switch)
- statement grouping
- decision making(if-else)
- looping with termination at top (while, for)
- early exit loop (break)
- Termination at bottom loop (do)

Return types: basic types, structures, unions or pointers. 

Local variables are created "automatic" or anew with each invocation. 

C **does not**:
- have built in operations to deal directly with composite objects
- does not define any storage allocation other than static definition 
- no heap or garbage collection
- no input/output facilities - no READ or WRITE statements
- no built-in file access methods

C **does offer**:
- straight forward, single-thread control flow
- tests
- loops
- grouping
- subprograms (not multiprogramming)
- parallel operations
- synchronization
- coroutines
