# Types, Operators, and Expressions
Variables/constants: basic data objects manipulated in a program
Declarations: list the variables to be used and state what type they have/initial values
Expressions: combine variables & constants to produce new values

## Variable Names
Restrictions on names of variables:
- First character must be a letter
- Don't begin with an underscore
- Uppercase/lowercase are different

Traditional practice:
- Use lowercase for variable names
- Uppercase for symbolic constants
