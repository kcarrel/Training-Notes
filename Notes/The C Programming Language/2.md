# Types, Operators, and Expressions
Variables/constants: basic data objects manipulated in a program
Declarations: list the variables to be used and state what type they have/initial values
Expressions: combine variables & constants to produce new values

## Variable Names
Restrictions on names of variables:
- First character must be a letter
- Don't begin with an underscore
- Uppercase/lowercase are different

Traditional practice:
- Use lowercase for variable names
- Uppercase for symbolic constants

## Data Types and Sizes
char: a single byte, capable fo holding one character in the local character set

int: an integer, typically reflecting the natural size of integers on the host machine

float: single-precision floating point

double: double-precision floating point

short int sh; ----> 16 bits

long int counter; ----> 32 bits

**Unsigned numbers**
- always positive or zero
- obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2^n where the n is the number of bits in the type

**Signed Chars* 
- value between -128 and 127

## Constants
*Character constant* is an integer, written as one character within single quotes, such as 'x'. The value is the numeric value of the character in the machine's character set.

*Integer constant* is a decimal, octal(value starts with 0) or hexadeicmal number(value starts with 0x). Always positive until you specify a negative sign.

Complete set of escape sequences:
- \a : alert(bell) character
- \b : backspace
- \f : formfeed
- \n : newline
- \r : carriage return
- \t : horizontal tab
- \v : vertical tab
- \\ : backslash
- \? : question mark
- \" : double quote
- \ooo : octal number
- \xhh : hexadecimal number

A *constant expression* is an expression that only involves constants and is evaluated during compilation rather than run-time.


String constants can be concatenated at compile team:
"hello," "world" is == to "hello, world"


A string constant = an array of characters meaning a string ends in a null character so physical storage is num of chars + 1

There is no limit to how long a string can be but the program has to scan the entire string to determine length. 

**strlen(s)** returns the length of its character string argument excluding the null character.

'x' != "x"
The former is an integer used to produce the numeric value of the letter x in the machine's char set. The other is an *enumeration constant*. 

**enumeration constant** is a list of constant integer values 
ex: enum boolean { NO, YES };

*Enumeration variables offer the chance of checking and so are often better than #defines.*

## Declarations
A variable may also be initialized in its declaration.

char esc = '\\';
float eps =- 1.0e-5;

An explicitly initialized automatic variable is initialized each time the function or block it is init entered; the initializer may be any expression.

*External and static variables* are initialized to zero by default

*Automatic variables* for which there is no explicit initializer have undefined(garbage) values.
