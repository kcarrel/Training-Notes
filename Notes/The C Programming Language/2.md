# Types, Operators, and Expressions
Variables/constants: basic data objects manipulated in a program
Declarations: list the variables to be used and state what type they have/initial values
Expressions: combine variables & constants to produce new values

## Variable Names
Restrictions on names of variables:
- First character must be a letter
- Don't begin with an underscore
- Uppercase/lowercase are different

Traditional practice:
- Use lowercase for variable names
- Uppercase for symbolic constants

## Data Types and Sizes
char: a single byte, capable fo holding one character in the local character set

int: an integer, typically reflecting the natural size of integers on the host machine

float: single-precision floating point

double: double-precision floating point

short int sh; ----> 16 bits

long int counter; ----> 32 bits

**Unsigned numbers**
- always positive or zero
- obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2^n where the n is the number of bits in the type

**Signed Chars* 
- value between -128 and 127
