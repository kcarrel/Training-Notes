# Control Flow

## Statements and Blocks
An expression becomes a statement when it is followed by a semicolon. 

A semicolon is a *statement terminator*. 

Braces are used to group declarations and statements together into a *compound statement* or *block*. 

## If-Else
syntax
if (expression)
    statement 1
else 
    statement 2

The else is optional. 

## Else-If
syntax
if (expression)
    statement 1
else if (expression)
    statement 2
else 
    statement 3

## Switch
The *switch* statement is a multi-way decision that tests whether an expression matches one of a number of *constant* integer values, and branches accordingly.

syntax
    switch (expression) {
        case const-expr: statements
        case const-expr: statements
        default: statements
    }
A *default* is optional. 

A *break* statement causes an immediate exit from the *switch*.

*Break* and *return* are the most common ways to leave a switch. 

**Good form**: Put a *break* after the last case even though it is logically unnecessary - defensive programming ftw! 

## Loops - While and For

for (expr1; expr2; expr3)
    statement

The *for* is preferable when there is a simple initialization and increment. 
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)

The advantages of keeping loop control centralized are even more obvious when there are several nested loops. 

## Loops - Do-while

## Break and Continue

## Goto and Labels
