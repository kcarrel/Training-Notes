# Functions and Program Structure
Functions break larger computing tasks into smaller ones, and enable people to build on what others have done instead of starting over from scratch. 

**Generally** C programs consist of many small functions rather than one large one.

## Basics of Functions
*strindex* search position of a character in a string

The return statement is the mechanism for returning a value from the called function to its caller. Any expression can follow return:
    return expression;

The expression will be converted to the return type of the function if necessary. Parentheses are optional around the expression. 

If a function fails to return a value, its "value" is certain to be garbage. 

## Functions Returning Non-integers

**Atof** - a function in the C programming language that converts a string into a floating point numerical representation. 

Atof must declar the type of value it returns since it is not int. The type name precedes the function name:

ex: double atof(char s[])

The function atof must be declared and defined consistently. If there is an inconsistency in the same file it will be detected by the compiler but if in separate files it would not be detected and meaningless results occur!

**Note**: A mismatch can occur if there is no function prototype, a function is implicitly declared by its first appearance in an expression.

**Bad idea**: to use empty argument lists with newer C programs. This is only intended to permit older C programs to compile with new compilers.
