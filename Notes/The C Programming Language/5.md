# Pointers and Arrays
**Pointer**: a variable that contains the address of a variable.
*Note:* The type void * (pointer to void) replaces char * as the proper type for a generic pointer.
## Pointers and Addresses
A typical computer has an array of consecutively numbered or addressed memory. These can be manipulated individually or as a group.
**Common:**
1 byte: a char
Pair of 1 byte cells: can be treated as a short integer
Four adjacent bytes: form a long integer

**The unary operator: & - The address of an object**
Ex:
p = &c;
explanation: p is assigned the address of c and p is said to "point to" c.

The & operator is only applied to objects in memory 
Applied to: variables and array elements. 
Can't: expressions, constants or *register* variables.


**The unary operator: * - The indirection/dereferencing operator**
Accesses the object the pointer points to. 

ex:
```
int x = 1, y = 2, z[10];
int *ip;            /* ip is a pointer to int */

ip = &x;           /* ip now points to x */
y = *ip;           /* y is now 1 */
*ip = 0;           /* x is now 0 */
ip = &z[0];        /* ip now points to z[0] */
```
int *ip ---> says that the expression *ip is an int

* and & bind more tightly than arithmetic operators. 
examples:
y = *ip + 10; means that it takes whatever ip points at, adds 1 and assigns the result to y
*but*
*ip += 1; means that it increments what ip points to

Pointers are variables and can be used without dereferencing.
ex:
if iq is pointing to int:
iq = ip;
copies the contents of ip into iq; making iq point to whatever ip pointed to.
