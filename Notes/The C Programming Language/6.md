# Structures
A **structure** (alt name: record) is a collection of 1 or more variables that are grouped together under one name for convenience in handling. 

## Basic of Structures
2 components can be placed in a structure declared like this:

struct point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

**Members** are variables named in a structure. A member and a non-member variable can have the same name because the difference can be understood by context. 

A variable declaration with structure declaration:
struct Point
{
    int x, y;
} p1; <--- The variable p1 is declared with Point

An member of a particular structure is referred to in an expression by a construction of the form:
structure-name.member
A *struct declaration* defines a type. 

EX:
struct rect {
    struct point pt1;
    struct point p2;
};

struct rect screen;
screen.pt1.x

**Note:** Structure members cannot be initialized with declaration because when a datatype is declared no memory is allocated for it. 
Ex:
struct Point
{
    int x = 0; // will have a compiler error!
}
## Structures and Functions
*Legal Operations on a structure*
- copying a structure 
- assigning to a structure as a unit
- taking its address with &
- accessing its members

Structures **cannot** be compared. 

It is generally more efficient to pass a function a pointer to a structure rather than copying the entire structure. They work the same as pointers to ordinary variables!

- ()
- []

## Arrays of Structures
The structure declaration

struct key {
    char *word;
    int count;
} keytab[NKEYS];

ex:
struct key {
    char *word;
    int count;
} keytab[] = {
    {"auto", 0},
    {"break", 0},
    {"case", 0},
    {"char", 0},
    {"const", 0},
    {"continue", 0},
    {"default", 0},
    /*...*/
    {"unsigned", 0,
    {"void, 0},
    {"volatile", 0},
    {"while", 0}
};

*Note*: The inner braces around the keys are not necessary when initializers are simple variables or char strings.

#define NKEYS (sizeof keytab / sizeof(struct key))

another way....
#define NKEYS (sizeof keytab / sizeof keytab[0])  <--- advantage: does not need to be changed if the type changes

## Pointers to Structures

(keytab exercise example)
## Self-referential Structures

Problem: How can we organize the data to cope efficiently withb a list of arbitrary words?
1 solution:: keep the set of words seen so far sorted at all times.
**The solution**: Use a binary tree!

**Binary Tree**
A tree contains one node per word & each node contains:
- a pointer to the text of the word
- a count of the number of occurences
- a pointer to the left child node
- a pointer to the right child node

*Rules*
- No node may have more than 2 children nodes
- Might have only zero or one

Comparing against root you can use recursion to solve the problem. 

Worst case big-0: linear search (if words are in order)

**A Note:** It is desirable that there be only one storage allocator in a program, even though it allocates different kinds of objects. But this raises 2 questions:
- How does it meet the requirement of most real machines?
- What declarations can cope with the fact that an allocator must necessarily return different kind of pointers?
Alignment requirements can generally be satisfied easily, at the cost of some wasted space, by ensuring that the allocator always returns a pointer that means *all* alignment restrictions.

**In C** the proper method is to declar that malloc returns a pointer to void, then explicitly coerce the pointer into the desired type with a cast.
