# Structures
A **structure** (alt name: record) is a collection of 1 or more variables that are grouped together under one name for convenience in handling. 

## Basic of Structures
2 components can be placed in a structure declared like this:

struct point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

**Members** are variables named in a structure. A member and a non-member variable can have the same name because the difference can be understood by context. 

A variable declaration with structure declaration:
struct Point
{
    int x, y;
} p1; <--- The variable p1 is declared with Point

An member of a particular structure is referred to in an expression by a construction of the form:
structure-name.member
A *struct declaration* defines a type. 

EX:
struct rect {
    struct point pt1;
    struct point p2;
};

struct rect screen;
screen.pt1.x

**Note:** Structure members cannot be initialized with declaration because when a datatype is declared no memory is allocated for it. 
Ex:
struct Point
{
    int x = 0; // will have a compiler error!
}
## Structures and Functions
*Legal Operations on a structure*
- copying a structure 
- assigning to a structure as a unit
- taking its address with &
- accessing its members

Structures **cannot** be compared. 

It is generally more efficient to pass a function a pointer to a structure rather than copying the entire structure. They work the same as pointers to ordinary variables!

## Arrays of Structures
The structure declaration

struct key {
    char *word;
    int count;
} keytab[NKEYS];

ex:
struct key {
    char *word;
    int count;
} keytab[] = {
    {"auto", 0},
    {"break", 0},
    {"case", 0},
    {"char", 0},
    {"const", 0},
    {"continue", 0},
    {"default", 0},
    /*...*/
    {"unsigned", 0,
    {"void, 0},
    {"volatile", 0},
    {"while", 0}
};

*Note*: The inner braces around the keys are not necessary when initializers are simple variables or char strings.

#define NKEYS (sizeof keytab / sizeof(struct key))

another way....
#define NKEYS (sizeof keytab / sizeof keytab[0])  <--- advantage: does not need to be changed if the type changes
