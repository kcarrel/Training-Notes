# Input and Output

## Standard Input and Output
*getchar* returns the next input character each time it is called, or EOF when it encounters end of file. The symbolic constant EOF is defined in <stdio.h>
Input can be redireted if prog uses getchar:
prog <infile
otherprog | prog
*putchar* puts the character on the standard output which is by default the screen
Output can be directed to a file if the program uses putchar as:
prog >outfile
prog | anotherprog

## Formatted Output- Printf
The output function *printf* translates internal values to characters. 
printf converts, formats, and prints its arguments on the standard output under control of the format. Returns the number of characters printed. 

**2 types of format string's objects:**
- Ordinary characters (which are copied to the output stream)_
- Conversion specifications (which causes conversion and printing of the next successive arguments to printf) <-- begins with a % and ends with a conversion char

Between the % and the conversion character there may be (in order):
- A minus sign (specifics lef adjustment of the converted argument)
- A number that specifices the minimum field width (converted arg will be printed in a field at least this wide)
- A period (seperates the field width from the precision)
- A number, the precision, that specifies the maximum number of characters to be printed from a string, or the number of digits after the decimal point of a floating-point value, or the minimum number of digits for an integer. 
- An h if the integer is to be printed as a short, or 1 (letter ell) if as a long

**Basic Printf Conversions**

| Character               | Argument Type; Printed as  
|-------------------------|----------------------------
| d,i                     | int; decimal number        
| o                       | int; unsigned octal number (w/o a leading 0) 
| x, X                    | int; unsigned hexadecimal # (w/o leading 0x or 0X) 
| u                       | int; unsigned decimal number             
| c                       | int; single character           
| s                       | char *; print characters from the string until a '\0' or the number of characters given by the precision             
| f                       | double;[-]m.ddddd, where the number of d's is given by the precision (default 6)            
| e, E                    | double;[-]m.ddddde+_xx or [-]m.dddddE+-xx, where the number of d's is given by the precision (defayult 6)             
| g, G                    | double; use %e or %E if the exponent is less than -4 or greater than or equal to the precision; otherwise use %f. Trailing zeros and a trailing decimal point are not printed.             
| p                       | void *; pointer (implementation-dependent representation)           
| %                       | no argument is converted; print a %.             


The function sprintf does the same conversions as printf does, but stores the output in a string:
int sprintf(char *string, char *format, arg1, arg2,...)
