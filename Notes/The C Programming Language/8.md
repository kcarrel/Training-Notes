# The UNIX System Interface
The UNIX OS provides service through a set of system calls (functions within the operating system that may be called by user programs).

## File Descriptors
In UNIX OS *all input and output is done by reading or writing files*. 

**Proper Steps**
- In general before you can read or write a file you have to tell the system of your intent to do so (open a file).
- In general if you are going to write on a file you must create it or erase it's contents. The system will check if you can. If yes, you are returned a *file descriptor*. 
- The file descriptor is used (instead of name) to identify the file. 

**Redirect I/O to and from files with < and > 
ex: prog <infile >outfile

*In all cases* file assignments are changed by the *shell* not the program. The program does not know where its input/output comes/goes from. It only cares that is uses file 0 for input and 1 and 2 for output. 

## Low Level I/O - Read and Write
## Open, Creat, Close, Unlink
## Random Access - Lseek
## Example - An Implementation of Fopen and Getc
## Example - Listing Directories
## Example - A Storage Allocator
