# Process Creation

## Overview of fork(), exit(), wait() and execve()
- fork: allows a parent process to create a child process
- exit: terminates a process, freeing the resources used by the terminated process for reallocation
- wait: Suspends execution of the process until one of its children has been terminated. Or termination status of child is returned in the status argument of wait.
- execve: system call loads a new program into  a process's memory. 

## Creating a New Process: fork()
The *fork* system call creates a new process (child) by mkaing an almost exact duplicate of the calling process (the parent).
Key point: After fork, two processes exist and execution of each process continues from the point where fork returns. 

**File Sharing Between Parent and Child**
The child process receives duplicates of all the parent's file descriptors. 
You can manually design a program such that after a fork - the parent and child use different file descriptors, with each process closing unused descriptors.

**Memory Semantics of fork()**
Conceptually - we can consider fork() as creating copies of the parent's text, data, heap and stack segments. However, actually performing a simple copy of the parent's virtual memory pages into the new child process would be wasteful. 

**Controlling a process's memory footprint**
We can combine the use of fork and wait to control the memory footprint of a process. 
```
pid_t childPID;
int status;

childPid = fork();
if (childPid == -1)
    errExit("fork");

if (childPid == 0)
    exit(func(arg));

if (wait(&status) == -1)
    errExit("wait");

```
## The vfork() System Call
The *vfork* system call is a more efficient version of fork(), but is usually avoided because of its unusual semantics, whereby the child uses the parent's memory until it either peforms an exec() or terminates; in the meantime, execution of the parent process is suspended. 

Note: except where speed is **absolutely critical** new programs should avoid the use of vfork in favor of fork because fork is implemented using copy-on-write semantics. 

## Race Conditions After fork()
After a *fork* call we can't rely on the order in which the parent and the child are next scheduled to use the CPU(s). Programs that make assumptions about the occurrence of such errors depends on external factors such as system load, they can be difficult to find and debug. 
If we need to guarantee a particular order, we must use some kind of synchronization technique. 
- semaphores
- file locks
- sending messages between processes using pipes
- use signals

## Avoiding Race Conditions by Synchronizing with Signals
Examples
```
#include <signal.h>
#include "curr_time.h"                  /* Declaration of currTime() */
#include "tlpi_hdr.h"

#define SYNC_SIG SIGUSR1                /* Synchronization signal */

static void             /* Signal handler - does nothing but return */
handler(int sig)
{
}

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    pid_t childPid;
    sigset_t blockMask, origMask, emptyMask;
    struct sigaction sa;

    setbuf(stdout, NULL);               /* Disable buffering of stdout */

    sigemptyset(&blockMask);
    sigaddset(&blockMask, SYNC_SIG);    /* Block signal */
    if (sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &blockMask, &origMask) == -1)
        errExit("sigprocmask");

    sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);
    sa.sa_flags = SA_RESTART;
    sa.sa_handler = handler;
    if (sigaction(SYNC_SIG, &sa, NULL) == -1)
        errExit("sigaction");

    switch (childPid = fork()) {
    case -1:
        errExit("fork");

    case 0: /* Child */

        /* Child does some required action here... */

        printf("[%s %ld] Child started - doing some work\n",
                currTime("%T"), (long) getpid());
        sleep(2);               /* Simulate time spent doing some work */

        /* And then signals parent that it's done */

        printf("[%s %ld] Child about to signal parent\n",
                currTime("%T"), (long) getpid());
        if (kill(getppid(), SYNC_SIG) == -1)
            errExit("kill");

        /* Now child can do other things... */

        _exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);

    default: /* Parent */

        /* Parent may do some work here, and then waits for child to
           complete the required action */

        printf("[%s %ld] Parent about to wait for signal\n",
                currTime("%T"), (long) getpid());
        sigemptyset(&emptyMask);
        if (sigsuspend(&emptyMask) == -1 && errno != EINTR)
            errExit("sigsuspend");
        printf("[%s %ld] Parent got signal\n", currTime("%T"), (long) getpid());

        /* If required, return signal mask to its original state */

        if (sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &origMask, NULL) == -1)
            errExit("sigprocmask");

        /* Parent carries on to do other things... */

        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    }
}
```

## Exercises
24.1
1st: creates a new child
2nd: both child and parent fork making a total of four processes 
3rd: The four processes fork again, creating another child each
