# Pipes and FIFOS

Pipes are the oldest method of IPC on the UNIX system (1970s)

Pipes provide an elegant solution for having created two processes to run different programs/commands, how cna the shell allow the output produced by one process to be used as the input to the other process?

## Overview
Pipes were the first method of IPC under the UNIX system, and they are used frequently by the shell, as well as in other applications. They can be used to pass data between relate processes.

Ex: Using a pipe to connect to processes

[ls stdout fd 1]---> write end of pipe[pipe bytestream; unidirectional] read end of pipe --->[stdin (fd 0) wc]

**A pipe is a byte stream**
A pipe is a unidirectional, limited-capacity byte stream that can be used for communication between related processes.

Note: it is not possible to randomly access the data in a pipe using lseek()

**Reading from a pipe**
Attempts to read from a pipe that is currently empty block until at least one byte has been written to the pipe.
If the write end of a pipe is closed hten a process reading from the pipe will see end-of-file once it has read all remaining data in the pipe. 

**Pipes are unidirectional**
Data can only travel in one direction through a pipe. One end is for writing and one end is for reading.

Steam pips: bidirectional pipes  (best to avoid reliance on their semantics given differing availability on different UNIX implementations)

**Writes of up to PIPE_BUF bytes are guaranteed to be atomic**
Although blocks of data of any size can be written to a pipe, only writes that do not exceed PIPE_BUF bytes are guaranteed to be atomic.

An implementation should define PIPE_BUF and/or allow the call fpathconf(fd, _PC_PIPE_BUF) to return the actual upper limit for atomic writes. The PIPE_BUF limit affects exactly when data is transferred to the pipe. When writing up to PIPE_BUF bytes, write() will block if necessary until sufficient space is available in the pipe so that it can complete the operation atomically. 

**Pipes have a limited capacity**
A pipe is simply a buffer maintained in kernel memory which has a maximum capacity. Once a pipe is full, further writes ot the pipe block until the reader removes some data from the pipe. 
In general - the app never needs to know the exact capcity of a pipe. If you want to prevent the write processes from blocking, the processes reading from the pipe shoul be designed to read data as soon as it is available. 

## Creating and Using Pipes
The *pipe* system call creates a new pipe. 
Can use sys calls:
- read
- write
- fprintf
- fscanf
- fdopen
- filedes

Pipe uses:
- communication
- connection 

**Pipes allow communication between related processes**
Pipes can be used for communication between any 2 or more related processes as long as the pipe was created by a common ancestor before the series of fork() calls that led to the existence of the processes. 


**Closing unused pipe file descriptors**
Closing unused pipe file descriptors is essential to the correct use of pipes. 
When using pipes, we must be careful to close unused descriptors in order to ensure that reading processes detect end-of-file and writing processes recieve the SIGPIPE signal or the EPIPE error. (Usually, it is easiest to have the application writing to a pipe ignore SIGPIPE and detect a "broken" pipe via the EPIPE error.)

**Example: Using a pipe to communicate between a parent and child process**
```
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include "tlpi_hdr.h"

#define BUF_SIZE 10

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int pfd[2];                             /* Pipe file descriptors */
    char buf[BUF_SIZE];
    ssize_t numRead;

    if (argc != 2 || strcmp(argv[1], "--help") == 0)
        usageErr("%s string\n", argv[0]);

    if (pipe(pfd) == -1)                    /* Create the pipe */
        errExit("pipe");

    switch (fork()) {
    case -1:
        errExit("fork");

    case 0:             /* Child  - reads from pipe */
        if (close(pfd[1]) == -1)            /* Write end is unused */
            errExit("close - child");

        for (;;) {              /* Read data from pipe, echo on stdout */
            numRead = read(pfd[0], buf, BUF_SIZE);
            if (numRead == -1)
                errExit("read");
            if (numRead == 0)
                break;                      /* End-of-file */
            if (write(STDOUT_FILENO, buf, numRead) != numRead)
                fatal("child - partial/failed write");
        }

        write(STDOUT_FILENO, "\n", 1);
        if (close(pfd[0]) == -1)
            errExit("close");
        _exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);

    default:            /* Parent - writes to pipe */
        if (close(pfd[0]) == -1)            /* Read end is unused */
            errExit("close - parent");

        if (write(pfd[1], argv[1], strlen(argv[1])) != strlen(argv[1]))
            fatal("parent - partial/failed write");

        if (close(pfd[1]) == -1)            /* Child will see EOF */
            errExit("close");
        wait(NULL);                         /* Wait for child to finish */
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    }
}
```

## Pipes as a Method of Process Synchronization
As well as being used as a method of IPC, pipes can also be used for process synchronization. 
Advantage over synchronization using signals:
- it can be used to coordinate the actions of one process with multiple other (related) processes 
Disadvantage to synchronization using signals:
- Signals can be broadcast by one process to all of the members of a process group 

## Using Pipes to Connect Filters
Defensive programming ex:
```
if (pfd[1] != STDOUT_FILENO) {
    dup2(pfd[1], STDOUT_FILENO);
    close(pfd[1]);
}
```

**Example: Using a pipe to connect ls and wc**

```
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include "tlpi_hdr.h"

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int pfd[2];                                     /* Pipe file descriptors */

    if (pipe(pfd) == -1)                            /* Create pipe */
        errExit("pipe");

    switch (fork()) {
    case -1:
        errExit("fork");

    case 0:             /* First child: exec 'ls' to write to pipe */
        if (close(pfd[0]) == -1)                    /* Read end is unused */
            errExit("close 1");

        /* Duplicate stdout on write end of pipe; close duplicated descriptor */

        if (pfd[1] != STDOUT_FILENO) {              /* Defensive check */
            if (dup2(pfd[1], STDOUT_FILENO) == -1)
                errExit("dup2 1");
            if (close(pfd[1]) == -1)
                errExit("close 2");
        }

        execlp("ls", "ls", (char *) NULL);          /* Writes to pipe */
        errExit("execlp ls");

    default:            /* Parent falls through to create next child */
        break;
    }

    switch (fork()) {
    case -1:
        errExit("fork");

    case 0:             /* Second child: exec 'wc' to read from pipe */
        if (close(pfd[1]) == -1)                    /* Write end is unused */
            errExit("close 3");

        /* Duplicate stdin on read end of pipe; close duplicated descriptor */

        if (pfd[0] != STDIN_FILENO) {               /* Defensive check */
            if (dup2(pfd[0], STDIN_FILENO) == -1)
                errExit("dup2 2");
            if (close(pfd[0]) == -1)
                errExit("close 4");
        }

        execlp("wc", "wc", "-l", (char *) NULL);
        errExit("execlp wc");

    default: /* Parent falls through */
        break;
    }

    /* Parent closes unused file descriptors for pipe, and waits for children */

    if (close(pfd[0]) == -1)
        errExit("close 5");
    if (close(pfd[1]) == -1)
        errExit("close 6");
    if (wait(NULL) == -1)
        errExit("wait 1");
    if (wait(NULL) == -1)
        errExit("wait 2");

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

## Talking to a Shell Command via a Pipe: popen()

The popen() and pclose() functions allow a program to transfer data to or from a standard shell command, without needing to handle the details of creating a pipe, execing a shell, and closing unused file descriptors. 

Input checking is always required in programs that use popen to execute a shal command built from user input.
ex: #define POPEN_FMT "/bin/ls -d %s 2> /dev/null"

## Pipes and stdio Buffering
When we call popen with a mode of w then, by default, output is sent to the child process at the other end of the pipe only when the stdio buffer is filled or we close the pipe with pclose(). We need to ensure that the child process receives data on the pipe immediately, then we can either use periodic calls to fflush() or disable stdio buffering using the call setbuf(fp, NULL). This technique can also be used if we create a pipe using pipe() and then use fdopen() to obtain a stido stream corresponding to the write end of the pipe. 

## FIFOs
FIFOs are a variation on pipes that can be used for communication between any processes. 
FIFOs operate in exactly the same way as pipes except:
- they are created using mkfifo()
- have a name in the file system
- can be opened by any process with appropriate permissions. 
By default, opening a FIFO for reading blocks until another process opens the FIFO for writing, and vice versa.

*mkfifo* creates a new FIFO with the given pathname. 

**Using FIFOs and tee(1) to create a dual pipeline**
Using FIFOs, it is possible to create a fork in a pipeline, so that a duplicate copy of the output of a process is sent to another process in addition to its successor in the pipeline. In order to do this: we need to use the tee command, which writes two copies of what it reads from its standard input: one to standard output and the other to the file named in its command-line argument. 

## A Client-Server Application Using FIFOs

**Server program**
```
#include <signal.h>
#include "fifo_seqnum.h"

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int serverFd, dummyFd, clientFd;
    char clientFifo[CLIENT_FIFO_NAME_LEN];
    struct request req;
    struct response resp;
    int seqNum = 0;                     /* This is our "service" */

    /* Create well-known FIFO, and open it for reading */

    umask(0);                           /* So we get the permissions we want */
    if (mkfifo(SERVER_FIFO, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IWGRP) == -1
            && errno != EEXIST)
        errExit("mkfifo %s", SERVER_FIFO);
    serverFd = open(SERVER_FIFO, O_RDONLY);
    if (serverFd == -1)
        errExit("open %s", SERVER_FIFO);

    /* Open an extra write descriptor, so that we never see EOF */

    dummyFd = open(SERVER_FIFO, O_WRONLY);
    if (dummyFd == -1)
        errExit("open %s", SERVER_FIFO);

    /* Let's find out about broken client pipe via failed write() */

    if (signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN) == SIG_ERR)    errExit("signal");

    for (;;) {                          /* Read requests and send responses */
        if (read(serverFd, &req, sizeof(struct request))
                != sizeof(struct request)) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error reading request; discarding\n");
            continue;                   /* Either partial read or error */
        }

        /* Open client FIFO (previously created by client) */

        snprintf(clientFifo, CLIENT_FIFO_NAME_LEN, CLIENT_FIFO_TEMPLATE,
                (long) req.pid);
        clientFd = open(clientFifo, O_WRONLY);
        if (clientFd == -1) {           /* Open failed, give up on client */
            errMsg("open %s", clientFifo);
            continue;
        }

        /* Send response and close FIFO */

        resp.seqNum = seqNum;
        if (write(clientFd, &resp, sizeof(struct response))
                != sizeof(struct response))
            fprintf(stderr, "Error writing to FIFO %s\n", clientFifo);
        if (close(clientFd) == -1)
            errMsg("close");

        seqNum += req.seqLen;           /* Update our sequence number */
    }
}
```

**Client program**
```
#include "fifo_seqnum.h"

static char clientFifo[CLIENT_FIFO_NAME_LEN];

static void             /* Invoked on exit to delete client FIFO */
removeFifo(void)
{
    unlink(clientFifo);
}

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int serverFd, clientFd;
    struct request req;
    struct response resp;

    if (argc > 1 && strcmp(argv[1], "--help") == 0)
        usageErr("%s [seq-len]\n", argv[0]);

    /* Create our FIFO (before sending request, to avoid a race) */

    umask(0);                   /* So we get the permissions we want */
    snprintf(clientFifo, CLIENT_FIFO_NAME_LEN, CLIENT_FIFO_TEMPLATE,
            (long) getpid());
    if (mkfifo(clientFifo, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IWGRP) == -1
                && errno != EEXIST)
        errExit("mkfifo %s", clientFifo);

    if (atexit(removeFifo) != 0)
        errExit("atexit");

    /* Construct request message, open server FIFO, and send message */

    req.pid = getpid();
    req.seqLen = (argc > 1) ? getInt(argv[1], GN_GT_0, "seq-len") : 1;

    serverFd = open(SERVER_FIFO, O_WRONLY);
    if (serverFd == -1)
        errExit("open %s", SERVER_FIFO);

    if (write(serverFd, &req, sizeof(struct request)) !=
            sizeof(struct request))
        fatal("Can't write to server");

    /* Open our FIFO, read and display response */

    clientFd = open(clientFifo, O_RDONLY);
    if (clientFd == -1)
        errExit("open %s", clientFifo);

    if (read(clientFd, &resp, sizeof(struct response))
            != sizeof(struct response))
        fatal("Can't read response from server");

    printf("%d\n", resp.seqNum);
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

## Nonblocking I/O

The O_NONBLOCK flag is useful if we don't want to block while opening a FIFO. It is also useful if we don't want reads to block if no data is available, or writes to block if there is insufficient space within a pipe or FIFO.
```
fd = open("fifopath, O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK);
if (fd == 1)
    errExit("open");
```

**Nonblocking read() and write()**
Scenarios where we may need to change the state of the O_NONBLOCK flag for a FIFO that is already open:
- We opened a FIFO using O_NONBLOCK, but we want subsequent read() and write() calls to operate in blocking mode
- We want to enable nonblocking mode for a file descriptor that was returned by pipe(). More generally, we might want to change the nonblocking status of any file descriptor that was obtained other than from a call to open() - for example, one of the three standard descriptors that are automatically opened for each new program run by the shell or a file descriptor returned by socket()
- For some app-specific purpose, we need to switch the setting of the O_NONBLOCK setting of a file descriptor on and off.

enable flag:
```
int flags;
flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL);
flags |= O_NONBLOCK;
fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags);
```
disable flag:
```
flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL);
flags &= ~O_NONBLOCK;
fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags);

```

## Semantics of read() and write() on Pipes and FIFOs
The only difference between blocking and nonblocking reads occurs when no data is present and the write end is open. In this case, a normal read() blocks, while a nonblocking read() fails with the error EAGAIN. 

The O_NONBLOCK flag causes a write() on a pipe or FIFO to fail (with the error EAGAIN) in any case where data can't be transferred immediately.
