# File I/O: Further Details

## Atomicity and Race Conditions
*Atomicity* - the actions performed by a sys call are executed as a single uninterruptible step (ensured by the kernel).

*Race conditions/race hazards*: is a situation where the result produced by two processes (or threads) operating on a shared resources depends in an unexpected way on the relative order in which the processes gain access to the CPU(s).

Example of trying to create/open two files simultaneously 
- The fact that the outcome of these operations depends on the order of scheduling of the two processes means that this is a race condition.
- Using a single open() call with O_CREAT and O_EXCL flags guarantees that the check and creation steps are carried out as a single atomic operation and cannot be interrupted. 

**Appending data to a file**
If multiple processes are trying to append data to the same file we have the same need for atomicity. 
Using O_APPEND guarantees us the atomicity necessary. 

## File Control Operations: fcntly()
The *fcntl()* system call performs a range of control operations on an open file descriptor. 
Return value on success depends on cmd performed or -1 if error. 

## Open File Status Flags

Fcntl() can be used to retrieve or modify the access mode and open file status flags of an open file using cmd as F_GETFL. 

To check the access mode of the file - mask the *flags* value with the constant O_ACCMODE and then test for equality with one of the constants.
```
accessMode = flags & O_ACCMODE;
if (accessMODE == 0_WRONLY || accessMode == O_RDWR)
printf("file is writeable \n)
```
## Relationship Between File Descriptors and Open Files

## Duplicating File Descriptors

## File I/O at a Specified Offset: pread() and pwrite()

## Scatter-Gather I/O: readv() and writev()

## Truncating a File: truncate() and ftruncate()

## Nonblocking I/O

## I/O on Large Files

## The /dev/fd Directory


## Creating T emporary Files
