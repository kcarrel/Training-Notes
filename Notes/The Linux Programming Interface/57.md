# Sockets: Unix Domain

UNIX domin sockets allow communication between applications on the same host. The UNIX domain supports both stream and datagram sockets.

## Unix Domain Socket Addresses: struct sockaddr_un
A UNIX domain socket is identified by a pathname in the file system. 

struct sockaddr_un {
    sa_family_t sun_family; /* Always AF_UNIX */
    char sun_path[108];     /* Null-terminated socket pathname */
};

Note about binding a UNIX domain socket:
- can't bind a socket to an existing pathname
- usual to bind a socket to an absolute pathname, so that the socket resides at a fixed address in the file system.
- a socket may be bound to only one pathnamel conversely, a pathname can be bound to only one socket
- can't use open() to open a socket
- When socket is no longer required, its pathname entry can be removed using unlink() (or remove())

## Stream Sockets in the UNIX Domain
A simple UNIX domain stream socket server
```
#include "us_xfr.h"
#define BACKLOG 5

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    struct sockaddr_un addr;
    int sfd, cfd;
    ssize_t numRead;
    char buf[BUF_SIZE];

    sfd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (sfd == -1)
        errExit("socket");

    /* Construct server socket address, bind socket to it,
       and make this a listening socket */

    /* For an explanation of the following check, see the errata notes for
       pages 1168 and 1172 at http://www.man7.org/tlpi/errata/. */

    if (strlen(SV_SOCK_PATH) > sizeof(addr.sun_path) - 1)
        fatal("Server socket path too long: %s", SV_SOCK_PATH);

    if (remove(SV_SOCK_PATH) == -1 && errno != ENOENT)
        errExit("remove-%s", SV_SOCK_PATH);

    memset(&addr, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_un));
    addr.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
    strncpy(addr.sun_path, SV_SOCK_PATH, sizeof(addr.sun_path) - 1);

    if (bind(sfd, (struct sockaddr *) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)) == -1)
        errExit("bind");

    if (listen(sfd, BACKLOG) == -1)
        errExit("listen");

    for (;;) {          /* Handle client connections iteratively */

        /* Accept a connection. The connection is returned on a new
           socket, 'cfd'; the listening socket ('sfd') remains open
           and can be used to accept further connections. */

        cfd = accept(sfd, NULL, NULL);
        if (cfd == -1)
            errExit("accept");

        /* Transfer data from connected socket to stdout until EOF */

        while ((numRead = read(cfd, buf, BUF_SIZE)) > 0)
            if (write(STDOUT_FILENO, buf, numRead) != numRead)
                fatal("partial/failed write");

        if (numRead == -1)
            errExit("read");

        if (close(cfd) == -1)
            errMsg("close");
    }
}
```

Server performs the following steps:
- creates a socket
- remove any existing file with the same pathname as that to which we want to bind the socket
- construct an address structure for the server's socket, bind the socket to that address, and mark the socket as a listening socket
- Execute an infinite loop to handle incoming client requests:
    - Accept a connection, obtaining a new socket, cfd, for the connection
    - Read all of the data from the connected socket and write it to standard output
    - Close the connected socket cfd

## Datagram Sockets in the UNIX Domain
A simple UNIX domain stream socket client

```
#include "us_xfr.h"

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    struct sockaddr_un addr;
    int sfd;
    ssize_t numRead;
    char buf[BUF_SIZE];

    sfd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);      /* Create client socket */
    if (sfd == -1)
        errExit("socket");

    /* Construct server address, and make the connection */

    memset(&addr, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_un));
    addr.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
    strncpy(addr.sun_path, SV_SOCK_PATH, sizeof(addr.sun_path) - 1);

    if (connect(sfd, (struct sockaddr *) &addr,
                sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)) == -1)
        errExit("connect");

    /* Copy stdin to socket */

    while ((numRead = read(STDIN_FILENO, buf, BUF_SIZE)) > 0)
        if (write(sfd, buf, numRead) != numRead)
            fatal("partial/failed write");

    if (numRead == -1)
        errExit("read");

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);         /* Closes our socket; server sees EOF */
}
```

Client program performs the following steps:
- Creates a stocket
- Construct the address structure for the server's socket and connect to the socket at the address
- Execute a loop that copies its stdin to the socket connection. Upon encountering EOD in its standard input, the client terminates, with the result that its socket is closed and the server sees EOF when reading from the socket on the other end of the connection. 

## Datagram Sockets in the UNIX domain

**Maximum datagram size for UNIX domain datagram sockets**
Limits are controlled via the SO_SNDBUF socket option and various /proc files, as described in the socket(7) manual page. 
Portable applications employing UNIX domain datagram sockets should consider imposing a low upper limit on the size of datagrams use.

## Unix Domain Socket Permissions
File permissions can be used to control access to a UNIX domain socket. 

To connect to a UNIX domain stream socket: write permissions is required on the socket file
To send a datagram to a UNIX domain datagram socket: write permissions is required on the socket file

To change permissions - use the bind call with a call to unmask to disable the permissions that we do not wish to grant. 

## Creating a Connected Socket Pair: socketpair()
The socketpair() system call creates a pair of connected UNIX domain sockets. This avoids the need for multiple system calls to create, bind and connect the sockets. A socket pair is normally used in a similar fashion to a pipe:
- one process creates the socket pair
- then forks to create a child that inherits descriptors referring to the sockets
the 2 processes can then communicate via the socket pair.

## The Linux Abstract Socket Namespace
The Linux-specific *abstract socket namespace* allows us to bind a UNIX domain socket to a name that doesn't appear in the file system. 

Advantages:
- we dont need to worry about possible collisions with existing names in the file system
- not necessary to unlink the socket pathname when we have finished using the socket. The abstract name is automatically removed when the socket is closed.
- we don't need to create a file-system pathname for the socket. This may be useful in a chroot environment, or if we don't have write access to a file system. 

ex:
```
#include <sys/un.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include "tlpi_hdr.h"

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int sockfd;
    struct sockaddr_un addr;
    char *str;

    memset(&addr, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_un));  /* Clear address structure */
    addr.sun_family = AF_UNIX;                     /* UNIX domain address */

    /* addr.sun_path[0] has already been set to 0 by memset() */

    str = "xyz";        /* Abstract name is "\0xyz" */
    strncpy(&addr.sun_path[1], str, strlen(str));

    // In early printings of the book, the above two lines were instead:
    //
    // strncpy(&addr.sun_path[1], "xyz", sizeof(addr.sun_path) - 2);
    //            /* Abstract name is "xyz" followed by null bytes */

    sockfd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (sockfd == -1)
        errExit("socket");

    if (bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *) &addr,
            sizeof(sa_family_t) + strlen(str) + 1) == -1)
        errExit("bind");

    // In early printings of the book, the final part of the bind() call
    // above was instead:
    //        sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)) == -1)

    sleep(60);

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```
