# Processes

## Processes and Programs
A *process* is an instance of an executing program. 
A *program* is a file containing a range of information that describes how to construct a process at run time. 
- *Binary format identification*: Each program file contains metainformation describing the format of the executable file. 
- *Machine-language instructions*: Encodes the algorithm of the program
- *Program entry-point address*: This identifies the location of the instruction at which execution of the program should commence
- *Data*: The program file contains valuies used to initialize variables and also literal constants used by the program 
- *Symbol and relocation tables*: These describe the locations and names of functions and variables within the program.
- *Shared-library and dynamic-linking information*: The program file includes fields listing teh shared libraries that the program needs to use at run time and the pathname of the dynamic linked that should be used to load these libraries.
- *Other information*: The program file contains various other information that describes how to construct a process. 

## Process ID and Parent Process ID
Process IDs are used and returned by a variety of system calls. The process ID is useful if we need to build an identifier that is unique to a process. 
*getpid()* system call returns the process ID of the calling process. 
*getppid()* system call returns the parent process ID of the calling process. 
If a child process becomes orphaned - the ppid returns 1.

## Memory Layout of a Process
- *Text Segment* contains the machine language instructions of the program run by the process. The text segment is read only and shareable.
- *Initialized data segment* contains global and static variables that are explicitly initialized. Values of these variables are read from the executable file when the program is loaded into memory. 
- *Uninitialized data segment* contains global and static variables that are not explicitly initialized.  *
- *Stack* is a dynamically growing and shrinking segment containing stack frames
*Program break* top end the heap.

## Virtual Memory Management 
*Virtual Memory Management* aims to make efficient use of both the CPU and RAM (physical memory) by exploiting a property that is typical of most program: *locality of reference*.

**2 kinds of locality**
- *Spatial locality*: tendency of a program to reference memory addresses that are near those that were recently accesses
- *Temporal locality*: tendency of a program to access the same memory addresses in the near future that it accessed in the recent past (because of loops)

*Benefit of locality of reference*: It is possible to execute a program while maintaining only part of its address space in RAM.

A *page fault* occurs when a process references a page that is not currently resident in physical memory. 

Benefit of VMM: more processes can simultaneously be held in RAM.
